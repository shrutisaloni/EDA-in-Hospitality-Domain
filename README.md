This project analyzes hotel occupancy rates across different room categories and cities. It uses Python and Pandas to process the data from fact_bookings.csv and extract key insights.
Data Handling & Preprocessing
  •	The first few cells import necessary libraries (pandas) and load a dataset.
  •	The data is likely stored in a CSV or database, which is read into a DataFrame.
  •	Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) checks for:
      o	Missing values
      o	Data types
      o	Basic statistical summaries
Occupancy Rate Calculation
This is grouped by room category, providing insights into which types of rooms are most frequently booked.
Trend Analysis
 •	It may use time-series analysis (e.g., grouping by month, week, or day) to see:
      o	Booking patterns over time
      o	Growth trends
Revenue Analysis
 •	Revenue calculations likely involve:
     o	Grouping revenue contributions by room category and time periods.
     o	Identifying high and low revenue-generating periods.
Visualization & Insights
 •	The notebook likely uses matplotlib or seaborn for visualizations such as:
     o	Line graphs 
     o	Bar charts 
     o	Pie chart
Summary of Insights
Based on the structure of the notebook, possible insights include:
 •	Which room types are most popular (based on occupancy rates).
 •	Booking seasonality trends (e.g., peak months).
 •	Revenue breakdown by category
